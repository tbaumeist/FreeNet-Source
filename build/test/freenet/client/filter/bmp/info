	small.bmp = file of size less than 54 bytes
	one.bmp = (0-1) start word change to AB from BM
	two.bmp = (6-9) Invalid offset i.e. starting address
	three.bmp = (14-17) Invalid size of bitmap info header
	four.bmp = (18-21) Negative Image width
	five.bmp = (26-27) Invalid no of planes
	six.bmp= (28-29) Invalid bit depth
	seven.bmp= (30-33) Invalid compression type
	eight.bmp=(34-37) Invalid Image data size (i.e. not satisfying fileSize=headerSize+imagedatasize)
	nine.bmp= (38-41, 42-45) Invalid Image resolution
	ten.bmp= changing the bitDepth to another valid value so that the verification of file size w.r.t. image dimension and bitdepth would fail.
